        content: "<p>10 days back, a doctor posted in the Covid 19 screening duty tested positive in Guwahati Medical College. Following that, a whopping number of around 500 tests were done among his contacts. But none came out to be positive.</p><p>In contrast, 5 days later, when a manual laborer from Fancy Bazar area named Mungru Sahani was found to be Covid 19 positive, within 24 hours, 15 more tested positive among his contacts.</p><p>Before we try to understand this contrast, first let us clear one established fact about Covid 19. The infectivity of this disease ( the chance of transmission) is highest when that person is symptomatic ( that is having symptoms like fever, cough etc). This is one of the reason why thermal scan is done at important places like airport, railway stations etc.</p><p>If we follow this logic, for obvious reasons, we can understand that, symptomatic persons, will definitely be more in places like a designated Covid 19 hospital - say, GMCH. Yet, why the chance of transmission is quite low in a hospital area as compared to a bazaar, where mostly people are asymptomatic ? Why this contrast?</p><p>The answer lies in awareness. In any situation, when, we as a living being are aware of the dangers in our environment, we perform better. The body's flight or fight response helps us protect from that danger.</p><img src='/images/blog1-2.jpeg' /><p>Whether we are patients going to the hospital, or we are doctors caring for the sick people, every moment, we are alert and aware of the threat in our environment. From repeated hand washing, to frequent use of sanitizers, wearing a face mask properly, not spitting here and there, maintaining social distancing, we take all the precautions. But the same thing doesn't happen when we visit a market place or a grocery shop. Our brain which is in relaxation mode, fails to alert us about any imminent danger in our environment.</p><p>So, how we respond ? We tend to put our mask in the chin, or pull it down further while speaking with the shopkeeper, we lock our heads together at the fish market, we yawn, we laugh, we cough in unison. After hoarding as much as we can, touching everything, everyone and everywhere we reach our home. Only after arriving at home, looking at our kids, our brain puts the alert button switched on and start pumping adrenaline to our system. But by then, usually damage is already done.</p><p>The same thing happens to us as speakers. It has been seen that 41% of world leaders, speakers, teachers, CEOs turn down the opportunity of a speaking gig when presented to them. Because, they fear public speaking, just like us, who fear going to a hospital in these days, because of the threat in the environment.</p><p>But this fear is normal, but irrational. This fear, if managed well, will help us to think faster, act smarter, react wiser. If you are sick, you need to go to the hospital, if you are a speaker, you need to face the fear of public speaking. You never know what difference you can bring to the world by walking fearlessly to the hospital or by expressing your thoughts confidently in front of others.</p><p>Now, when we know we have a speaking assignment ( similar to the situation when we are about to enter a hospital) we become more alert. We prepare ourselves better, we study our audience, our environment, to handle the situation better. The audience is also prepared to listen to us ( just like other people who have stepped into a hospital are aware of our presence).</p><p>For this simple reason, when we are aware of the threat in our surroundings, we prepare better and when we prepare better, we perform better.</p><p>So, next time, if you have fever or any other Covid 19 related symptoms, don't fear to visit a hospital. In hospital everyone, you and your fellow human beings are alert to their surroundings, whereas in a bazaar, everyone is ignorant of their surroundings.</p><p>Never fail to visit a hospital when you are sick, and never fail to grab an opportunity to speak when you are asked to speak.</p>",

        content: "<p>Covid-19 pandemic crisis can be craftily used to plough through long pending, deep-rooted structural, economical and behavioral reforms.One such much needed reform is dependency.The opposite of it in a wider sense can be independency, self-contained, self-reliant or atma nirbharta.</p><p>This isn't a new word at all but the melee it has caused is not worth the time and situation. We should be happy for children especially teenagers, who gave a piece of hearing to their living room discussions and looked up for it on Google. We are witnessing catastrophic transformation and if we do not understand self containment now, at this juncture, then when ? Needless to explain, I am not talking about the Atmanirbharta Bharat Abhiyan Yojana, I am just stressing on the pressing need of this attitude.</p><p> I feel most of the urban kids around us are living life in panoramic perfection of air conditioned, fully furnished, overstaffed and high speed internet equipped houses. They do not need to worry about waiting as when would this lockdown be over. To such ones,I have a question, what if covid-19 affects them in indirect way ie what if the staff migrates to his village? What if Wi-Fi connection gets lost or what if there is a financial crunch? Would they be self sustainable? We need to ponder and have answers for such unprecedented times. </p><p>It is a common sight to see parents feeding a ten year old, working on their assignments till late night, addressing the child’s simplest problem to school authorities, tidying a teenager’s room, even looking into daily school routine and packing the bag of a tenth grader. Self reliance should begin right from the start, we should only hold a child’s finger till the time he learns to walk, rest can be managed with communicating, counseling and day to day interacting. We understand the plight of a doting parent but banning foreign goods or isolating from global forum is certainly not self reliance. When we are in doubts next time for an excessively dependent child , please find answers to these questions ---What if? if not now, then when?.</p><img src='/images/blog2-2.jpeg' /><p>As a speaker, I feel this self containment journey is all the more special and should be taken up voluntarily at the earliest.Firstly,we need to stand up for ourselves, if not for anything else, if not for doing something for others but only for us. Because the time has come, nothing can save us if are not self reliant.</p><p>It feels truly special when someone speaks for themselves or for anyone else around. It can be for anything; challenges, bonhomie, trust,request to excel, inquisitiveness to learn, anguish to express but one has to hone the art of expressing oneself because expression of thought and belief is one step taken towards self containment.It is a stellar achievement towards having one confident self.</p><p>It is very popular saying in my village in Rajasthan that even your mum would not feed you, if you don't ask for food and you have to walk to the well to quench your thirst and not vice versa. When such triviality needs self reliance expression then what do think of humongous task which may come crashing onto you when you expect it the least.</p><p>To young and old, feeble and bold, the mention of self containment should not be a reason of anxiety but a stairway to have a contented and secured life. Don’t wait for another epidemic; my hand shivers to mention pandemic, for a change in attitude. Get up, Speak up as this can be a small and facile step but definitely a way forward to self reliance – Atmanirbharta !</p>",

        content: "<p>Be the 'mask warriors' of Assam : It's our ingenuity, our pride - An analogy from speaker's perspective</p><p>When we confront a highly contagious virus, whether it's HIV or Corona, we need to adopt a behavioral change in communication pattern between people. In case of HIV, sexual behavior of people needs a change. In case of Covid19, we need to change social and hygiene related behavior like social distancing, washing hands, wearing mask etc.</p><p>But how can we bring this change in behavior among millions of people ? Do you think it can be done by using brute force or imposing fines or creating legislation ? Certainly not.</p><p>Applying force can bring about a behavioral change may be for a few days, but it will hardly have a long lasting effect. As police atrocities increased during initial phase of lockdown, people behaved well, but as the lockdown was relaxed, people started to relax as well, wearing mask at the chin, opening the mask while speaking, or at times not wearing at all.</p><p>Now, the question arises, how can we motivate so many people for a longer period of time to bring about a behavioral change ?</p><p>In 1954, a psychologist named Abraham Maslow, did a research about what motivates people. Accordingly, he prepared Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It's a bottom up list...</p><p>8) Transcendence - help others realize their potential.<br />7) Self-actualization - realize our potential<br />6) Aesthetic - symmetry, beauty<br />5) Learning - know, understand<br />4) Esteem - achieve, competent<br />3) Belonging - Love, family<br />2) Security - Protection, Safety<br />1) Physical - hunger, thirst</p><p>According to Maslow, you can't fulfill your aesthetic needs until your physical needs were taken care of ( In Maslow's world, there was no starving artists).</p><p>However, subsequent researches suggested that Maslow's theory was wrong.</p><p>Most speakers and marketers try to motivate people by addressing the lowest 3 layers - physical, security, esteem - basically invoking 'self - interest ' in the mind of people. The upper layers of aesthetic, self actualization and Transcendence they feel are more academic. Yet, researches has shown that it is the other way round.</p><p>Let me give you an example. Suppose, we as a speaker are asked to write a one liner message for a TV commercial, which should motivate people to wear mask, then which sentence you feel will be more appealing -</p><p>1. Wear mask or face a fine of Rs. 500 - choice is yours.</p><p>2. Wear mask - save yourself, save your loved ones.</p><p>3. Be the 'mask warriors'of Assam - It's our ingenuity, our pride.</p><p>Now, if we come to the first one liner, it seems we want to enforce it by force - which we have seen doesn't work over a longer period of time.</p><p>If we look at the second one liner, it addresses the lower layer of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs ( security - protection, safety, belonging - love, family) basically invoking self interest.</p><p>If we come to the third one liner, it calls for the the upper layers of needs ( Aesthetic, self actualization) and if you do a research, I can tell you, this one liner which portrays the pride and ingenuity of the people of Assam is going to motivate a larger section - from farmers to entrepreneurs.</p><p>When faced with a situation like this, people usually asks three questions - 1) Who am I ? 2) What kind of situation is this ? 3) And what do people like me do in this situation ? Group interest precedes over self interest. Our group affiliation may be based on race, class, religion, gender, political party or countless other dimensions.</p><p>So, as a speaker, while formulating our key message, to motivate a large section of people, remember one thing - we need to address the upper layers of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, as people whether poor or rich, hungry or satiated, urban or rural make decisions based on identity rather than self interest. </p>",

        content: "<p>Why do we fear ghosts or spirits or distant lands or darkness or aliens .The list can be endless and different for everybody but one fact remains common to all. It is the fear of unknown, fear of something which stays  unexplored.</p> <p>The present time is fearful for everyone and we all are living one day at a time. Here too it is because Covid-19 is yet unknown and quite ambiguous to all. The source is not clear, the line of treatment is vague, the life ahead seems so cryptic. We stand here to be safe in the minutest way possible.In other words, we have become so cautious because the present enemy is invisible, it is unknown to us.</p><p> Each one is fighting their own battle on the fence. The frontline workers are directly exposed to the risk but in the hindsight all are battling day in and day out. The old and sick who are at greater risk is struggling to cope up with the anxiety, the youth are depressed to witness the sick state of affairs in their heydays and the newborn is actually free form the woman to face the quarantined world.</p><p>As the lockdown is being lifted partially increasing the scope of exposure in area and in time, as we are unfolding the new ways and getting equipped to fight this indiscernible and imperceptible enemy,we are also getting adapted to a new way of life. At times we even sense,that this victory to have a corona immuned world which stays delayed at present will surely not denied when we hear about the researches revolving around the discovery of medicines and vaccines. So it all lies in our ability to initiate the  programming of our mind  and in our efforts to unfold the underlying mystery</p><p>Fear of public speaking is just like fear of unknown. It only bothers you till the time you hit the stage .The chief cause of one's fear is simply that you are unaccustomed to doing it and the road from being fearful to overcoming the fear can be tedious and quite a challenging one.</p><p>But wait, this unknown fear can be conquered. Just like we approach the doctors, when we feel we are experiencing the symptoms of Covid or any disease, we should immediately  find a coach who can hold our hand and help us overcome this fear of public speaking. We need to follow the instructions and practice them religiosly just the way we follow a doctor's advice when we are diseased.</p><p>It is a step by step process. All you need is to augment your courage, focus in your dreams, put together your thoughts ,pour it out on paper and look for your voice in a teacher around you. The teacher can bring out your unheard yet the best voice in you. It is never too late to face this unknown fear. One should believe in one's spirit to yearn to learn. Once you have that, you will successfully vanquish your rival.</p>"

        content: "<p>Just after PM Narendra Modi announced his desire for a self reliant India, social media erupted with optimism, skepticism to jingoism. People even started giving fervent call for boycotting all foreign ( specially Chinese) made products. But in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent economy world over, hardly this type of jingoism make any sense. Then where lies the solution ? I, though,  fall in the optimistic group. To fulfill this dream we need two pronged strategy - 1) To encourage frugal and flexible innovation. 2) Governance with purpose.</p><p>How many of you know Mr Kanak Das ? Well, Mr. Kanak Das is a frugal innovator who hails from a remote village in Morigaon district of Assam. Like many Indians, Das rides a bicycle to work. As in many parts of India, the road he travels are full of potholes and bumps. These not only gave him back problems, but slowed him down considerably. Das knew there was little or nothing he could do to improve the quality of these roads.</p><p>So, instead of being bogged down by external circumstances, armed with resilience and perseverance, he asked himself one question 'What if I can actually find a way to make my cycle run faster on these lumpy bumpy roads ?' That question inspired him to retrofit his bicycle so that every time the front wheel hits a bump, a shock absorber compresses and releases energy to the rear wheel. By converting the energy in the shock absorber into a propulsive force, his bicycle could run faster on bumpy roads.</p><p>This was a whole new concept that Kanak Das has pioneered. Who knows where this might lead. In the not so distant future, cyclists all over the world may benefit from Kanak Das's frugal innovation. Already engineering students at MIT are using Das's invention as inspiration for how to convert the energy generated by shock absorbers in automobiles into acceleration. This attitude of seeking opportunity in adversity, doing more with less, thinking and acting flexibly ( ref : Jugaad concept - by Navi Radjou, Jaideep Prabhu, Simone Ahuja ) from Indian entrepreneurs, both small and large, is the best alternative towards self reliant India. This should be wholeheartedly encouraged and tried in every household of India.</p><p>Next comes governance with purpose. Can anyone tell me why Make In India concept is still in cold storage ? Let me explain it. Once Bob McDonald, CEO of Procter & Gamble said, ' If an idea or technology cannot be commercialized, it is not an innovation. In India, we don't have any dearth of idea, but the problem lies with governance. Till today securing the necessary licences to construct a simple warehouse involves 34 procedures over 227 days on an average. Running a business is even harder. Property rights are often unclear and hard to ascertain. Acquiring land is fraught with difficulty. Labor laws are complex and restrictive, with 47 national laws and 157 state regulations. New taxes are instituted and applied anytime. Court cases are expensive and drag on for years. These bottlenecks need to be released. Only naming and renaming of dreams and projects will not suffice. There has to be governance with purpose and not governance of rhetorics.</p><p>The core message needs a change. If you look at the Make in India slogan, it is 'Zero defect, zero effect.' Zero effect is fine, it should have no effect on the environment. But why aim for zero defect ? It is way too straitjacket approach. Without aiming for high end utopian goal, we should aim for more pragmatic 'Value for money' strategy. </p><p>The core message needs a change.

What about you? </p>"

How could you do this Sushant? You could have waited for happy times. All you had to do was to call a friend, why this?</p><p>The elders in the family groups had their own piece of Jnan. Not strangely enough they summarized that suicide happens because the youth of this generation is not strong, unlike them, they are cut off from their roots, they are pampered, materialistic, undisciplined, self centered, self obsessed and selfish. And depression is just another term for detachment and a disability to accept refusal. To them I wanted to point out, majority of elderly people suffer from depression. People who retire before time, especially men who find themselves disposable are depressed because all their lives have been spent being \"useful\". This is one section of population who do not talk about mental health. Or else, let me put it this way; they would never want to accept the fact that depression is also a clinical term and it can be cured.</p><p>My adolescent daughter was so upset that she was in tears almost the entire day. I explained her it was completely unfateful and shocking too, but according to the World Health Organization, one person commits suicide every 40th second. Farmers commit suicide, aspiring engineers, doctors commit suicide, the unemployed, unaccepted commit suicide, the abused women; both educated and uneducated commit suicide -- thousands and millions of them every year. But she was not to be blamed because all possible social media platforms had just one news RIP SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT. Indeed it was horrifying news undoubtedly, but the way, the media dissected the entire episode, it was equally shameful indeed, also we still don’t know the fact behind this heinous incident, suicide or murder.</p><p>I personally believe suicide should not belong to the privileged people because that is like taking the easy way out. Apart from Sushant Singh, there have been over 300 deaths in India triggered by the nationwide lockdown. But hardly anyone made up to the headlines!</p><p>Suicide is as personal as it is political. And it always has been. It is as much about structural failure-- it is really important that as a community of people, we question some of the things we endorse as values—putting up a brave front, give your best smile to the society. I feel so sorry to witness that we are merely reduced to what we can earn, how productive we are, how much we can provide, how successful we are at what we do, how many cars we own, how beautiful we are-- these are the things that oil the machinery of social currency! Mental health discourses should make us question what we value as people and not that \"it’s going to be okay\" by showing toxic positivity. Depression is more common than you think-- your denial would never help. It is common among people you perceive as strong and happy. This rhetoric of strength and cowardice is stigmatizing, for those alive, for those that have attempted suicide, battling suicidal thoughts and live in shame for it. For those that think of dying by suicide but are too scared to share suicidal thoughts in fear of being judged. Do not stigmatize emotions, moods and feelings. The dead needs NOTHING; those who are alive need kindness, need empathy, need company, need to know that you actually care, that you are actually there!</p>"

Over here, first I tried to communicate with her, our son is a slow learner, so she needs to accept it and make him understand at his own pace.But immediately it evoked a relationship trigger in her and she switchtracked the conversation to sharing responsibility. In another switchtracking, instead of accepting to share responsibility, I went for the excuse of time constraint, which in turn led her to question my responsibility towards my family.</p><p>Now let us take another example -</p><p>[ A conversation between the coach and Ravi ( player) after Ravi is replaced by another player in the playing eleven ]</p><p><span class='font-bold'>Coach - </span>\"Ravi, today Ankit will be playing in your place, as we need to select players based on 'horses for courses'.\"</p><p><span class='font-bold'>Ravi - </span>\"Is it ? Why don't you say, I am dropped and you prefer Ankit over me.\"</p><p><span class='font-bold'>Coach - </span>\"Given the condition, we need to play an extra bowler.\" </p><p><span class='font-bold'>Ravi -</span>\"I know all these petty politics, I shall never get back into the team again. You are hell-bent to ruin my career.\"</p><p>Now what happened here ? The coach was thinking about his team for the match. But it led to relationship trigger in Ravi,who immediately switchtracked the conversation to politics in the team and individual preferences.</p><p>The dynamic of above two conversations is so common in our daily life ( teacher - student, boss - employee, husband - wife, mother- daughter), that hardly ever we realize when one switchtrack into a different topic. The conversation smoothly gets shifted as if by railroad switch, from one topic to other. So, finally, we are each heading in our own direction, moving further & further apart. This way the conversation gets tangled, and both of us get lost as we hear the other person through the filter of our own topic.</p><p>But switch tracking is not always bad. The second topic being put on the table may be more important than the first one. For example, previously, my wife might have been hesitant to bring up the responsibility sharing issue before me. But now it is out in the open and needs to be dealt with.</p><p>At times switchtracking can be worse, specially for people who switchtracks silently. In the first conversation suppose my wife switchtracks silently inside herself, without firing a reply, she may start thinking like this - \"Wow, you are telling me to calm down. What else you have to share with us except advise and jnan ? You have made our life miserable.\" She then goes out and vents her frustration somewhere else.</p><p>Now comes the big question, how can we have fruitful conversation during a switchtrack situation ? There are two ways how we can prevent switchtracking -</p><p>1) First, we need to spot the switchtrack and the two different topics on the table.<br/>2)	Secondly, we need to give each topic its own conversation track.</p><p>So, from today we are going to practice switchtrack spotting. At the point at which you realize there are two topics running simultaneously, say that loud and propose a way forward. Something like this, \" I see two related but separate topics to discuss. They are both important. Let us discuss each topic fully but separately, giving each topic its own track. After we have finished the first topic we shall swing back around and discuss the second one.\" It breaks the normal reactive conversation pattern by being straightforward.</p><p>Then another problem may arise, which topic to discuss first ? If you have spotted the switchtrack correctly, listen to your partner's topic first. This will help you hear their topic and at the end of the day, that is what they care about.</p><p>If you can apply this simple trick during any difficult conversation, your relationship will be better, you will learn and grow from other's feedback as well.</p>"

For example, when Uber shuts down, Uber drivers who depend upon it for their daily wage - and are in the process of paying EMIs for the vehicles they have bought (often to Uber itself) - are hit.</p><p>(c) The loss of income from a lock-down has spillover impacts in a number of other domains, such as housing (you can't pay rent, so you risk eviction), property (default on loans), and so on.</p><p>(d) A national lockdown means that women in abusive/violent relationships are essentially - trapped.</p><p>What strikes me is that we have concepts for all of these - the right to equality, the right to livelihood, the right to housing - and so on, but because these rights have never actually been rigorously developed in the context of the political economy, that is because of every ruling party has been moulding these rights according to their political agenda. They've got no real bite when it really comes to a crisis. So instead of making enforceable claims upon the State - as we should - we are reduced to pleading with the State to come up with a relief package (which some state governments have done).</p><p>It seems to me - to repeat - an imperative now that anyone thinking or working in the field of human rights needs to urgently pivot towards embedding rights within the political economy, because crisis such as Covid-19 are only going to intensify in the near future.</p><p>Let this begin from each one of us, not necessarily only for ourselves but to help others in the society. This is why independence was sought and how constitution was formed, because they thought of the future and not just present. Stop right there when you simply blame, instead get up and start the journey for rectification. Fundamental rights can only be well implemented when all of us stand in solidarity to work on redundant process and fight for what is right, not just for us but for other fellow beings too.</p>"
