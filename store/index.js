        content: "<p>10 days back, a doctor posted in the Covid 19 screening duty tested positive in Guwahati Medical College. Following that, a whopping number of around 500 tests were done among his contacts. But none came out to be positive.</p><p>In contrast, 5 days later, when a manual laborer from Fancy Bazar area named Mungru Sahani was found to be Covid 19 positive, within 24 hours, 15 more tested positive among his contacts.</p><p>Before we try to understand this contrast, first let us clear one established fact about Covid 19. The infectivity of this disease ( the chance of transmission) is highest when that person is symptomatic ( that is having symptoms like fever, cough etc). This is one of the reason why thermal scan is done at important places like airport, railway stations etc.</p><p>If we follow this logic, for obvious reasons, we can understand that, symptomatic persons, will definitely be more in places like a designated Covid 19 hospital - say, GMCH. Yet, why the chance of transmission is quite low in a hospital area as compared to a bazaar, where mostly people are asymptomatic ? Why this contrast?</p><p>The answer lies in awareness. In any situation, when, we as a living being are aware of the dangers in our environment, we perform better. The body's flight or fight response helps us protect from that danger.</p><img src='/images/blog1-2.jpeg' /><p>Whether we are patients going to the hospital, or we are doctors caring for the sick people, every moment, we are alert and aware of the threat in our environment. From repeated hand washing, to frequent use of sanitizers, wearing a face mask properly, not spitting here and there, maintaining social distancing, we take all the precautions. But the same thing doesn't happen when we visit a market place or a grocery shop. Our brain which is in relaxation mode, fails to alert us about any imminent danger in our environment.</p><p>So, how we respond ? We tend to put our mask in the chin, or pull it down further while speaking with the shopkeeper, we lock our heads together at the fish market, we yawn, we laugh, we cough in unison. After hoarding as much as we can, touching everything, everyone and everywhere we reach our home. Only after arriving at home, looking at our kids, our brain puts the alert button switched on and start pumping adrenaline to our system. But by then, usually damage is already done.</p><p>The same thing happens to us as speakers. It has been seen that 41% of world leaders, speakers, teachers, CEOs turn down the opportunity of a speaking gig when presented to them. Because, they fear public speaking, just like us, who fear going to a hospital in these days, because of the threat in the environment.</p><p>But this fear is normal, but irrational. This fear, if managed well, will help us to think faster, act smarter, react wiser. If you are sick, you need to go to the hospital, if you are a speaker, you need to face the fear of public speaking. You never know what difference you can bring to the world by walking fearlessly to the hospital or by expressing your thoughts confidently in front of others.</p><p>Now, when we know we have a speaking assignment ( similar to the situation when we are about to enter a hospital) we become more alert. We prepare ourselves better, we study our audience, our environment, to handle the situation better. The audience is also prepared to listen to us ( just like other people who have stepped into a hospital are aware of our presence).</p><p>For this simple reason, when we are aware of the threat in our surroundings, we prepare better and when we prepare better, we perform better.</p><p>So, next time, if you have fever or any other Covid 19 related symptoms, don't fear to visit a hospital. In hospital everyone, you and your fellow human beings are alert to their surroundings, whereas in a bazaar, everyone is ignorant of their surroundings.</p><p>Never fail to visit a hospital when you are sick, and never fail to grab an opportunity to speak when you are asked to speak.</p>",

        content: "<p>Covid-19 pandemic crisis can be craftily used to plough through long pending, deep-rooted structural, economical and behavioral reforms.One such much needed reform is dependency.The opposite of it in a wider sense can be independency, self-contained, self-reliant or atma nirbharta.</p><p>This isn't a new word at all but the melee it has caused is not worth the time and situation. We should be happy for children especially teenagers, who gave a piece of hearing to their living room discussions and looked up for it on Google. We are witnessing catastrophic transformation and if we do not understand self containment now, at this juncture, then when ? Needless to explain, I am not talking about the Atmanirbharta Bharat Abhiyan Yojana, I am just stressing on the pressing need of this attitude.</p><p> I feel most of the urban kids around us are living life in panoramic perfection of air conditioned, fully furnished, overstaffed and high speed internet equipped houses. They do not need to worry about waiting as when would this lockdown be over. To such ones,I have a question, what if covid-19 affects them in indirect way ie what if the staff migrates to his village? What if Wi-Fi connection gets lost or what if there is a financial crunch? Would they be self sustainable? We need to ponder and have answers for such unprecedented times. </p><p>It is a common sight to see parents feeding a ten year old, working on their assignments till late night, addressing the child’s simplest problem to school authorities, tidying a teenager’s room, even looking into daily school routine and packing the bag of a tenth grader. Self reliance should begin right from the start, we should only hold a child’s finger till the time he learns to walk, rest can be managed with communicating, counseling and day to day interacting. We understand the plight of a doting parent but banning foreign goods or isolating from global forum is certainly not self reliance. When we are in doubts next time for an excessively dependent child , please find answers to these questions ---What if? if not now, then when?.</p><img src='/images/blog2-2.jpeg' /><p>As a speaker, I feel this self containment journey is all the more special and should be taken up voluntarily at the earliest.Firstly,we need to stand up for ourselves, if not for anything else, if not for doing something for others but only for us. Because the time has come, nothing can save us if are not self reliant.</p><p>It feels truly special when someone speaks for themselves or for anyone else around. It can be for anything; challenges, bonhomie, trust,request to excel, inquisitiveness to learn, anguish to express but one has to hone the art of expressing oneself because expression of thought and belief is one step taken towards self containment.It is a stellar achievement towards having one confident self.</p><p>It is very popular saying in my village in Rajasthan that even your mum would not feed you, if you don't ask for food and you have to walk to the well to quench your thirst and not vice versa. When such triviality needs self reliance expression then what do think of humongous task which may come crashing onto you when you expect it the least.</p><p>To young and old, feeble and bold, the mention of self containment should not be a reason of anxiety but a stairway to have a contented and secured life. Don’t wait for another epidemic; my hand shivers to mention pandemic, for a change in attitude. Get up, Speak up as this can be a small and facile step but definitely a way forward to self reliance – Atmanirbharta !</p>",

As police atrocities increased during the initial phase of lockdown, people behaved well, but as the lockdown was relaxed, people started to relax as well, wearing a mask at the chin, opening the mask while speaking, or at times not wearing at all.</p><p>Now, the question arises, how can we motivate so many people for a longer period to bring about a behavioral change?</p><p>In 1954, a psychologist named Abraham Maslow researched what motivates people.

Accordingly, he prepared Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. It's a bottom-up list...<br/>7) Self-actualization - realize our potential<br/>Aesthetic - symmetry, beauty<br/>5) Learning - know, understand<br/>4) Esteem - achieve, competent<br/>3) Belonging - Love, family<br/>2) Security - Protection, Safety<br/>2) Security - Protection, Safety</p><p>According to Maslow, you can't fulfill your aesthetic needs until your physical needs were taken care of ( In Maslow's world, there were no starving artists).</p><p>However, subsequent researches suggested that Maslow's theory was wrong.</p><p>Most speakers and marketers try to motivate people by addressing the lowest 3 layers - physical, security, esteem - basically invoking 'self - interest ' in the mind of people. The upper layers of aesthetics, self-actualization, and Transcendence they feel are more academic. Yet, researches have shown that it is the other way round.</p><p>Let me give you an example. Suppose, we as a speaker are asked to write a one-liner message for a TV commercial, which should motivate people to wear the mask, then which sentence you feel will be more appealing -</p><p>1. Wear a mask or face a fine of Rs. 500 - the choice is yours.<br/>1. Wear a mask or face a fine of Rs. 500 - the choice is yours.<br/>3. Be the 'mask warriors' of Assam - It's our ingenuity, our pride.</p><p>Now, if we come to the first one-liner, it seems we want to enforce it by force - which we have seen doesn't work over a longer period.</p><p>If we look at the second one-liner, it addresses the lower layer of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs ( security - protection, safety, belonging - love, family) invoking self-interest.</p><p>If we look at the second one-liner, it addresses the lower layer of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs ( security - protection, safety, belonging - love, family) invoking self-interest.</p><p>When faced with a situation like this, people usually ask three questions - 1) Who am I ? 2) What kind of situation is this? 3) And what do people like me do in this situation? Group interest precedes over self-interest. Our group affiliation may be based on race, class, religion, gender, political party, or countless other dimensions.</p><p>So, as a speaker, while formulating our key message, to motivate a large section of people, remember one thing - we need to address the upper layers of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, as people whether poor or rich, hungry or satiated, urban or rural make decisions based on identity rather than self-interest.</p>",

It is the fear of the unknown, fear of something which stays unexplored.</p><p>The present time is fearful for everyone and we all are living one day at a time. Here too it is because Covid-19 is yet unknown and quite ambiguous to all. The source is not clear, the line of treatment is vague, the life ahead seems so cryptic. We stand here to be safe in the minutest way possible. In other words, we have become so cautious because the present enemy is invisible, it is unknown to us.</p><p>Each one is fighting their own battle on the fence. The frontline workers are directly exposed to the risk but in the hindsight, all are battling day in and day out. The old and sick who are at greater risk is struggling to cope up with the anxiety, the youth are depressed to witness the sick state of affairs in their heydays and the newborn is free form the woman to face the quarantined world.</p><p>As the lockdown is being lifted partially increasing the scope of exposure in the area and in time, as we are unfolding the new ways and getting equipped to fight this indiscernible and imperceptible enemy, we are also getting adapted to a new way of life. At times we even sense, that this victory to have a corona immuned world which stays delayed at present will surely not denied when we hear about the researches revolving around the discovery of medicines and vaccines. So it all lies in our ability to initiate the programming of our mind and in our efforts to unfold the underlying mystery</p><p>Fear of public speaking is just like the fear of the unknown. It only bothers you till the time you hit the stage. The chief cause of one's fear is simply that you are unaccustomed to doing it and the road from being fearful to overcoming the fear can be tedious and quite a challenging one.</p><p>Fear of public speaking is just like the fear of the unknown.

People even started giving a fervent call for boycotting all foreign (especially Chinese) made products. But in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent economy world over, hardly this type of jingoism make any sense. Then where lies the solution? I, though, fall in the optimistic group. To fulfill this dream we need a two-pronged strategy - <br/> 1) To encourage frugal and flexible innovation. <br/>2) Governance with purpose.</p><p>How many of you know Mr.Kanak Das? Well, Mr.Kanak Das is a frugal innovator who hails from a remote village in Morigaon district of Assam. Das rides a bicycle to work, like the many other Indians. As in many parts of India, the road he travels is full of potholes and bumps. These not only gave him back problems but slowed him down considerably. Das knew that he may do a little to improve the roads or he may do nothing. So, instead of being bogged down by external circumstances, armed with resilience and perseverance, he asked himself one question 'What if I can find a way to make my cycle run faster on these lumpy bumpy roads?'. And that one question that he asked himself, inspired him to retrofit his bicycle. When the wheel hits a bump, every time a shock absorber compresses and releases energy to the rear wheel. By converting the energy in the shock absorber into a propulsive force, his bicycle could run faster on bumpy roads.</p><p>How many of you know Mr.Kanak Das?

Can anyone tell me why Make In India's concept is still in cold storage? Let me explain it. Once Bob McDonald, CEO of Procter & Gamble said, ' If an idea or technology cannot be commercialized, it is not an innovation. In India, we don't have any dearth of ideas, but the problem lies with governance. Till today securing the necessary licenses to construct a simple warehouse involves 34 procedures over 227 days on average. Running a business is even harder. Property rights are often unclear and hard to ascertain. Acquiring land is fraught with difficulty. Labor laws are complex and restrictive, with 47 national laws and 157 state regulations. New taxes are instituted and applied anytime. Court cases are expensive and drag on for years. These bottlenecks need to be released. Only the naming and renaming of dreams and projects will not suffice. There has to be governance with purpose and not the governance of rhetoric.</p><p>Next comes governance with purpose.

If you look at the Make in India slogan, it is 'Zero defect, zero effect.' Zero effect is fine, it should not affect the environment. But why aim for zero-defect? It is way too straitjacket approach. Without aiming for a high-end utopian goal, we should aim for a more pragmatic 'Value for money' strategy.</p><p>The slogan should be - 'frugal innovation, efficient administration, eco-friendly solutions'.If we can encourage many more Kanak Das around us to come out with low-cost frugal innovations, coupled with the abolition of license Raj and ease of business, I am optimistic of a self-reliant India.

How could you do this Sushant? You could have waited for happy times. All you had to do was to call a friend, why this?</p><p>The elders in the family groups had their piece of Jnan. Not, strangely enough, they summarized that suicide happens because the youth of this generation is not strong, unlike them, they are cut off from their roots, they are pampered, materialistic, undisciplined, self-centered, self-obsessed and selfish. And depression is just another term for detachment and disability to accept refusal. To them I wanted to point out, the majority of elderly people suffer from depression. People who retire before time, especially men who find themselves disposable are depressed because all their lives have been spent being \"useful\". This is one section of the population who do not talk about mental health. Or else, let me put it this way; they would never want to accept the fact that depression is also a clinical term and it can be cured.</p><p>My adolescent daughter was so upset that she was in tears almost the entire day. I explained to her it was completely unfateful and shocking too, but according to the World Health Organization, one person commits suicide every 40th second. Farmers commit suicide, aspiring engineers, doctors commit suicide, the unemployed, unaccepted commit suicide, the abused women; both educated and uneducated commit suicide -- thousands and millions of them every year. But she was not to be blamed because all possible social media platforms had just one news RIP SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT. Indeed it was horrifying news undoubtedly, but the way, the media dissected the entire episode, it was equally shameful indeed, also we still don’t know the fact behind this heinous incident, suicide, or murder.</p><p>I believe suicide should not belong to the privileged people because that is like taking the easy way out. Apart from Sushant Singh, there have been over 300 deaths in India triggered by the nationwide lockdown. But hardly anyone made up to the headlines!</p><p>Suicide is as personal as it is political. And it always has been. It is as much about structural failure-- it is really important that as a community of people, we question some of the things we endorse as values—putting up a brave front, give your best smile to the society. I feel so sorry to witness that we are merely reduced to what we can earn, how productive we are, how much we can provide, how successful we are at what we do, how many cars we own, how beautiful we are-- these are the things that oil the machinery of social currency! Mental health discourses should make us question what we value as people and not that \"it’s going to be okay\" by showing toxic positivity. Depression is more common than you think-- your denial would never help. It is common among people you perceive as strong and happy. This rhetoric of strength and cowardice is stigmatizing, for those alive, for those that have attempted suicide, battling suicidal thoughts, and live in shame for it. For those that think of dying by suicide but are too scared to share suicidal thoughts in fear of being judged. Do not stigmatize emotions, moods, and feelings. The dead needs NOTHING; those who are alive need kindness, need empathy, need company, need to know that you actually care, that you are there!</p>"

Over here, first I tried to communicate with her, our son is a slow learner, so she needs to accept it and make him understand at his own pace.But immediately it evoked a relationship trigger in her and she switchtracked the conversation to sharing responsibility. In another switchtracking, instead of accepting to share responsibility, I went for the excuse of time constraint, which in turn led her to question my responsibility towards my family.</p><p>Now let us take another example -</p><p>[ A conversation between the coach and Ravi ( player) after Ravi is replaced by another player in the playing eleven ]</p><p><span class='font-bold'>Coach - </span>\"Ravi, today Ankit will be playing in your place, as we need to select players based on 'horses for courses'.\"</p><p><span class='font-bold'>Ravi - </span>\"Is it ? Why don't you say, I am dropped and you prefer Ankit over me.\"</p><p><span class='font-bold'>Coach - </span>\"Given the condition, we need to play an extra bowler.\" </p><p><span class='font-bold'>Ravi -</span>\"I know all these petty politics, I shall never get back into the team again. You are hell-bent to ruin my career.\"</p><p>Now what happened here ? The coach was thinking about his team for the match. But it led to relationship trigger in Ravi,who immediately switchtracked the conversation to politics in the team and individual preferences.</p><p>The dynamic of above two conversations are so common in our daily life ( teacher - student, boss - employee, husband - wife, mother- daughter), that hardly ever we realize when one switchtrack into a different topic. The conversation smoothly gets shifted as if by railroad switch, from one topic to another. So, finally, we are each heading in our own direction, moving further & further apart. This way the conversation gets tangled, and both of us get lost as we hear the other person through the filter of our topic.</p><p>But switch tracking is not always bad. The second topic is put on the table may be more important than the first one. For example, previously, my wife might have been hesitant to bring up the responsibility sharing issue before me. But now it is out in the open and needs to be dealt with.</p><p>At times switch tracking can be worse, specially for people who switch tracks silently. In the first conversation suppose my wife switches tracks silently inside herself, without firing a reply, she may start thinking like this - \"Wow, you are telling me to calm down. What else you have to share with us except advise and jnan ? You have made our life miserable.\" She then goes out and vents her frustration somewhere else.</p><p>Now comes the big question, how can we have fruitful conversation during a switch track situation ? There are two ways how we can prevent switchtracking -</p><p>1) First, we need to spot the switch track and the two different topics on the table.<br/>2)	Secondly, we need to give each topic its own conversation track.</p><p>So, from today we are going to practice switch track spots. At the point at which you realize there are two topics running simultaneously, say that loud and propose a way forward. Something like this, \" I see two related but separate topics to discuss. They are both important. Let us discuss each topic fully but separately, giving each topic its own track. After we have finished the first topic we shall swing back around and discuss the second one.\" It breaks the normal reactive conversation pattern by being straightforward.</p><p>Then another problem may arise, which topic to discuss first ? If you have spotted the switch track correctly, listen to your partner's topic first. This will help you hear their topic and at the end of the day, that is what they care about.</p><p>If you can apply this simple trick during any difficult conversation, your relationship will be better, you will learn and grow from other's feedback as well.</p>"

Research shows that the ability to work from home is directly linked to the socio-economic class and the income bracket. The lower down you are, the more likely your job can't be done from home, and the more likely it is that you lose pay/lose your job. The most hit, of course, are daily wage laborers.</p><p>(b) Except for the formal employees, it hits the self-employed/gig workers badly. For example, when Uber shuts down, Uber drivers who depend upon it for their daily wage - and are in the process of paying EMIs for the vehicles they have bought (often to Uber itself) - are hit.</p><p>(c) The loss of income from a lock-down has spillover impacts in several other domains, such as housing (you can't pay rent, so you risk eviction), property (default on loans), and so on.</p><p>(d) A national lockdown means that women in abusive/violent relationships are essential - trapped.</p><p>What strikes me is that we have concepts for all of these - the right to equality, the right to livelihood, the right to housing - and so on, but because these rights have never actually been rigorously developed in the context of the political economy, that is because of every ruling party has been molding these rights according to their political agenda. They've got no real bite when it comes to a crisis. So instead of making enforceable claims upon the State - as we should - we are reduced to pleading with the State to come up with a relief package (which some state governments have done).</p><p>It seems to me - to repeat - an imperative now that anyone thinking or working in the field of human rights needs to urgently pivot towards embedding rights within the political economy because crisis such as Covid-19 is only going to intensify shortly.</p><p>Let this begin from each one of us, not necessarily only for ourselves but to help others in society. This is why independence was sought and how the constitution was formed because they thought of the future and not just the present. Stop right there when you simply blame, instead get up and start the journey for rectification. Fundamental rights can only be well implemented when all of us stand in solidarity to work on redundant processes and fight for what is right, not just for us but for other fellow beings too.</p>",

        content: "<p>What is common about ears and eyes?</p><p>Well, ears and eyes both can be sealed or closed effectively. Sometimes both close at the same time, but more often the ear is turned off, while the eyes remain open. In either case, the mind's attention is turned to other matters than what is being heard or seen.</p><p>Some of us spend hours in front of the TV thinking something else, letting the images pass across the screen just as passive readers flip the pages of a book with little or no attention. This is the state of <b>intellectual somnolence, </b>a total loss, a waste of time.</p><p><b>But why we do, what we do?</b>The first thing we need to understand that listening, like reading is primarily an activity of mind, not of the ear or eye. When we are lost somewhere, not actively involved that is called hearing not listening, like seeing but not reading as our mind is not active in the process.</p><p>There are four key ways of communication - speaking, writing, reading, and listening. The commonest mistake that people make about both listening and reading is to regard them as passively receiving activity. But they do not make this mistake about writing and speaking. They recognize that writing and speaking are activities that require energy, effort, unflagging attention, and skill. They also realize that some persons are more skillful than others in these two activities and that increased skill can be acquired by practice.</p><p>Now, let us use an <b>analogy from the game of football. </b>The central back gives a long pass to his mid-fielder. Receiving the ball requires as much skill as pushing the ball forward. Though both require a different set of skills. But without the complementary efforts of both players, the game cannot move forward. Communication through the use of words is comparable. It is not completed unless the reader's or listener's mind reaches out to catch what is in the mind of the writer or speaker.</p><p>Of course, the fault may not always lie with the reader or listener. If the forward pass is way over the head of the mid-fielder - just like some pieces of writing and spoken utterances so devoid of meaning, coherence, that the best reader and listener can make little sense of them.</p><p><b>In between reading and listening, listening needs more skill. </b>Unlike reading, listening is subject to a limitation of time. We can only listen once to what is said to us and the pace of our listening is set by the pace of the speaker. We cannot stop the speaker and ask him to repeat something that was said earlier, as we can stop going forward to the next page to review the pages read earlier.</p><p>To counteract the widespread apathy and misunderstanding that exists concerning listening <b>Sperry,</b>a major American corporation has come out with a list of bad habits that interfere with effective listening. 1) Paying more attention to the speaker's mannerisms of the speech than the substance of what is being said 2) giving the appearance of paying attention to a speaker while allowing one's mind to wander off to other things3) allowing all sorts of distraction to divert one's attention from the speaker and the speech 4) over-reacting to certain words or phrases in the speech 5) allowing an initial lack of interest in the subject and worst of all 6) taking an occasion for listening as nothing more than an occasion for indulging in daydreaming.</p><p><b>How to overcome these bad habits? ( Sperry's)</b></p><p>A listener must start with at least an intellectual courtesy of assuming that the speech would be of sufficient interest and worthy of attention.</p><p>The essence of a good listener is to be a demanding listener, one who keeps awake while listening by having in mind the questions to be asked about the speech being listened to. The questions to be asked are -<br/>1. What is the whole speech about?<br/>2. What are the main ideas and arguments?<br/>3. Are the speaker's conclusion sound or mistaken?<br/>4. What is in it for me?</p><p>It is possible to have all these questions in mind while listening, but it is difficult to answer them at the same time that we are listening. Yet answering them later when reflecting upon what one has listened to is an indispensable adjunct to listening.</p><p>Skillful listening involves skillful note-taking, both while the speech is going on and after it is over.</p><p>In one of the meetings I just attended ( photograph attached) first I prepared my mind for active listening and then noted down points on those lines while listening to the speeches. Later on, when I was asked to deliver an impromptu speech, I could successfully use the <b>here and now </b>a phenomenon, involving points from all the previous speakers who spoke before me. The speech was highly appreciated. Even a couple of speakers called me the next day and thanked me for highlighting their points in my speech. This is the magic of active listening.</p><p>Friends, listening is a skill, <b>listen with the mind's ear</b>, practice so much that the skilled performance becomes habitual.</p><p><b>#In Micmellows, </b>we have one separate listening skill session every day to practice active listening.</p>"

        content: "<p>Couple of weeks back, I was sitting in my chamber in the middle of the lockdown. The number of cases of Covid 19 were suddenly increasing exponentially, so was the death rate. Tension was palpable every where. Sitting there, I decided to go for a small observational study on human behavior. </p><p>Over a period of 3 hours, leaving aside children below 10 years of age, 42 persons stepped inside my chamber. Of the 42 individuals, 3 were wearing mask at their chin, 12 were wearing their mask covering the mouth but not nose. 15 pulled down their mask while speaking and 1 came without mask. So, a total of 28 out of 42 were using mask wrongly, a whopping 58%, exposing themselves to the danger of infection.</p><p>On the same day, simultaneously I decided to go for a second observational study on children, who consulted me for fever. Out of 7 children who presented with fever, I advised Covid 19 testing in 5 cases. From the body language and verbatim of the parents, I found that all 5 were reluctant to go for the testing. Interestingly enough, ultimately after two successive visits to my chamber, on repeated coercing, one went for testing and that child turned out to be positive for Covid 19. A week later, his grandfather turned positive and is presently in ICU.</p><p>On the same day, simultaneously I decided to go for a second observational study on children, who consulted me for fever.

A week later, his grandfather turned positive and is presently in ICU.</p><p>While thinking on these lines, next day in the morning, I sat down in front of my laptop to attend an online meeting of a public speaking club. Oh my God ! I was in for a surprise. I listened to 4 speeches in succession, where speakers were more or less reading out from the notes. I started scratching my head - why don't they mutilate that piece of paper and throw it into the dustbin before delivering the speech. Who are they fooling around? We join public speaking club to practice speaking, not reading. By reading from the notes, you are basically fooling yourself.</p><p>This brought back to me, the question, why people do what they do and how can we reverse this behavior. If we closely look into all these three scenarios, the losers are the individual themselves. To reverse this behavior we need three pronged strategy - Understand, Assist and Encourage ( UAE)</p><p>Say, for example, someone may wear a mask in the mouth, not covering the nose due to a suffocating sensation. We need to first understand their problem sympathetically. This is normal and natural.  Assist them with the correct technique,  explain them, why it is important for him/her to wear correctly. It will help them from contracting the disease.  After assisting them with the knowledge, we need to encourage their corrected behavior. I often use the analogy of seat belt in this situation. When we first try to put seat belt while driving, it feels so uncomfortable. But as we understand it's value, we try for few more days. With repeated usage, it becomes a habit, where even before ignition, our hand automatically moves towards the seat belt.</p><p>Say, for example, someone may wear a mask in the mouth, not covering the nose due to a suffocating sensation.

We can only learn any skill (say public speaking) by making mistakes, several times, till we master that skill. Similarly, by prompt testing, we can prevent the spread of infection to other family members, mostly the vulnerable group, our parents, grand-parents. Moreover with timely intervention, we can save many lives.</p><p>Friends, it is our collective duty, in this time of crisis to help our fellow human beings with better understanding, support and encouragement. The pleasure in helping others through the path of ignorance to cognizance, from the fear of testing to the gift of life, from the state of diffidence to eloquence is truly gratifying.

And to my elation, I found an answer; the reason is lack of grooming; grooming to speak fearlessly for your rights. I would be highly satisfied if only one person changes after reading this. Irrespective of your religion, caste, or creed, there are few outrageously unethical wrong practices, which lead to \"psychological, physical and financial abuse \" of a daughter-in-law in India. Let me enumerate a few</p><p>The outsider- The main reason for evil, is the lack of acceptance of a daughter-in-law as part of the family. I have heard thousands of stories of how the husband and his parents, talk secretly in a room while the daughter-in-law is made to watch the television because she is an \"outsider\".</p><p>Insecurity - One of the most common mindsets of the groom’s parents is - \"that woman snatched away from our son from us.\” It is time to accept it, most Indian parents are selfish. So let’s keep the \"selfless love tag aside\". They \"invest\" time, money, and love on a son, so that he can repay by taking care of them in their old age. Yes, he should do that! He should do that. But not at the cost of someone else’s alienation. The fine print to this is - They expect him to behave like an obedient 5-year-old, even when he becomes the father of a 5-year-old child! They just get insecure when he starts voicing out his decisions.</p><p>Befriending a new member- Have you ever heard about the Adjustment phase or Adjustment disorder?</p><p>The adjustment phase is the time that the mind takes to adjust to a new environment.</p><p>Adjustment disorder is a very high level of sadness, fear, depression, and anxiety that one suffers, if the adjustment phase fails. In a great majority of cases, this disorder requires medicines for cure.</p><p>Adjustment disorder is a very high level of sadness, fear, depression, and anxiety that one suffers, if the adjustment phase fails. In a great majority of cases, this disorder requires medicines for cure.</p><p>Whether you are rich or powerful, it doesn’t matter at all. There are hardly some people who take their stand against the regressive thought process of society. Still, some mothers-in-law treat their daughter-in-law like slaves. They decide on her daily routine, feel pride in giving her \"holidays\" and sophisticatedly express their demands which she and her parents are supposed to fulfill. Strangely, a mother detests it but the same mother in law claims it as her rights. Have you thought about the reason? Do you remember – old habits die hard or you can also put it as old dogs take time to learn new tricks!</p><p>A man reading this blog must be questioning why I have left him out. No sir, I haven’t. Most men don't have the maturity to understand the emotional and social responsibility they have towards their wives right after their marriage. Most are not ready to accept the changes that life demands, once they get married. Most men cannot stand up to their parents and fight for their wives. And if ever they do, men become henpecked.</p><p>If you closely observe, everyone in such families is in a gagged state. There is never a time in their drawing rooms where they can openly confront, discuss, and resolve for everyone’s betterment. Why can’t a daughter in law be treated as your daughter? And if not, why does a mother in law expect herself to be treated as her mother? Why can’t passive aggression through gossiping, unnecessary intervention, and rigid rules be stopped? Why does a turbulent past of the mother in law become a future road map for her daughter-in-law and most importantly her son’s married life?

They walked into my chamber armed with face mask, gloves, sanitizer, separate linen for my examination table, and top of that with a pulse oximeter.</p><p>Mother started narrating the history, that her child suffers from fever and throat pain every year during June/July. This time, he is again having fever for the last 2 days and the same throat pain. We are originally from Dibrugarh and have recently shifted here. In Dibrugarh, whenever this happened, so and so the doctor would prescribe us azithromycin, paracetamol, and neopeptine and he would get cured within 3 days. This time also we contacted our doctor in Dibrugarh and he advised us to repeat the same medicines. So, we have started all these three medicines from yesterday.\"</p><p>I asked, \"why they come to me?\" The mother replied, \" See, doctor, the situation is very dangerous, so thought to have a consultation.\" After listening to her carefully, I examined the child. Apart from mild redness in the throat, there was nothing significant. The child was alert, active, and playful.</p><p>Then I silently wrote down my prescription with paracetamol, a multivitamin, and asked them to do a COVID 19 investigation. As I uttered the word COVID 19, the mother got agitated. She was certain that her son is not suffering from COVID-19 because he has never left home since March and they take utmost care in sanitization. This happens to him every year. The mother instead asked to change the antibiotic and try with something more powerful.</p><p>I calmly replied to her that, this is a government protocol and we cannot ignore this so, kindly get the test done and come back to me tomorrow. Till then please continue with the two medicines I have prescribed.\" Visibly she was annoyed with my approach and after applying a copious amount of sanitizers in her gloved hands, she slowly went out.</p><p>The next day, all of them returned to my chamber. I asked them whether they have got the test done. Expectedly so, she replied, \"No, we have not got the test done yet.\" So, I asked her, \"Why did you bring him again.\" She replied, \" Doctor, his fever is not subsiding, it went up to 104°F yesterday, so we want to go for the blood test and please, please write one antibiotic. Doctor, I am 100% certain, this is not COVID 19.\"</p><p>I looked at the child, who was otherwise active, examined him again. There was no sign of bacterial sore throat.</p><p>This time, accumulating all my patience, I explained, \" See, I respect your certainty, that this is not Covid19 infection and probability of not having it, is 95%, but if by any chance it turns out to be COVID 19, then all of you may get infected tomorrow. Over and above, there is a condition called \"happy hypoxia\" where even if you remain asymptomatic, your oxygen level may suddenly drop down and you might lose consciousness. So, as you have pleaded to me with a double please, I also plead before you, please please get the COVID 19 test done, following which I shall go for all the tests as you desire.\"</p><p>Frustrated, exasperated, irritated, she replied, \" Doctor, let me tell you one thing - this Corona pandemic is all political. If I go for the test, I am certain, they will falsely give a positive report and will put all of us in quarantine. Anyone who goes for the test, they make them positive and put them in isolation at some dirty place. I don't want this.\"</p><p>I replied, \“Ma’am please don't go by Facebook and WhatsApp forwarded messages, think rationally, and do whatever you feel best.\" Vexed with my reply, they left my chamber.</p><p>10 minutes later, the husband returned. He was looking extremely nervous. He was sweating profusely and was shaking. I asked, \"What happened?\" He replied, \"Sir just now after we left your chamber and sat in the car, the child complained of vomiting tendency. Immediately, I checked his oxygen level and found it to be 75%. Will you like to check him again.\" I said, \" Yes, surely. But, I think there might be some wrong with your procedure of checking. Anyway bring him in, I want to check once.\"</p><p>As the father was about to move out of my chamber, I heard a big commotion outside my chamber. The father ran out and came back with the limp child in his lap shaking and shivering.</p><p>\"Sir, as I was talking to you, he fell unconscious in the road outside your chamber.\" On settling the child on my examination table, I saw the child going pale and gasping for breath. I checked with the pulse oximeter. It read 85%. I immediately arranged his transfer to the nearby hospital.</p><p>10 days later, the father visited again and thanked me profusely for my timely advice and intervention. He informed me that both the child and his mother were tested COVID 19 positive. They got hospitalized and by the Grace of God, now they have recovered and has returned home.</p><p>Friends, on one hand, felt relieved to know that the child survived and on the other, this incident taught me an important life lesson. Certainty kills rationality.</p><p>Those words that day from the mother still keeps buzzing in my ears, \" Doctor, I am 100% certain, he is not suffering from COVID 19.\" Ladies and gentlemen, nothing is for certain until it has already happened. Our brain is an imperfect machine.</p><p>Once comedian Emo Philips said, \"I used to think the human brain was the most wonderful organ in my body. Then I realized who was telling me this.\" The unfortunate fact is, most of what we believe is the product of innate inaccuracies and biases present in our brain. Every new piece of information is measured against the values and conclusions we already have. Racists do racist things because they are certain about their genetic superiority. Religious fanatics blow themselves up and murder hundreds of people because they are certain of their place in heaven as martyrs.</p><p>Yes, I am extremely happy and I am sure the parents too, that the child survived. But had this test been done a day before, this life and death situation could have been averted.</p><p>I believe the certainty should be replaced by openness. Openness removes unnecessary stereotyping and biases. Openness opens a window of opportunity to learn and grow. Openness relieves us from our judgments and helps to look from another person's point of view. So,as the adage goes, the man who believes he knows everything learns nothing.\"</p><p>It's my request to all my readers, don't let your certainty kills your rationality. Be vulnerable to learn and listen to others.</p>"

Only if you could funnel your search to medical corruption, you will be left demoralized to question any further! When Commonwealth Games made more headlines for controversies and corruptions than games, when country’s defense is at stake several times for different innumerable scams, when banks get involved in scams, when the union ministry confirmed 1200 medical scams in 2019 where around 100 hospitals were de-empanelled from government listing, when 9.4 billion was robbed off from government treasury for a simple substance like fodder, could we do anything? \"</p><p>Now we can surely do our bit, it has been confirmed that Covid is transmitted at a lightning speed and we can stop the chain. We can’t stay at home true, but when we need to step out, we can follow the guidelines. We should be socially responsible. If we win this argument and prove it is some kind of a scam, we precisely win nothing. But I can’t fathom, if we lose our lives or our dear ones to Covid due to negligence, what do we derive then? </p><p>Also, the continuously rising graph says the deaths have surpassed the 7.5 lk figure, let us follow the guidelines and be socially responsible instead of weighing the importance of our lives to these novice arguments. We are common people; let us just understand what adds to our common sense. When this pandemic ends hopefully with the end of 2020, we will surely have one thing to realize and remember, life is precious, rest everything takes a back seat when it comes to save life.</p>"

        content: "<p>It was drizzling outside while I was driving my car. My wife was sitting quietly at the back. Suddenly she noticed I was smiling on my own. She inquired, “What happened? Why are you smiling?” I said, “Well, Arka (our ten-year-old son) and I were chatting this morning, when he said, “Dad, everyone says, you and I are alike, what do you think?” I said, “I also think so, maybe we share some facial similarity.” After all, you are my son. By the way, have you asked your mom about this?” He said no he didn’t ask but rather he says that, “we share the same patience, but mama and bonu (sister) are same, with lack of tolerance. They start howling and growling if anything goes against them, even by a millimetre.”</p><p>Well, immediately, a reply came from my back. “Ha! Only after marriage I have lost all my patience. Only because of a girl like me, I could stay in this house of robots.” Immediately I could sense the conversation is now going to switch track, and the discussion is going to turn into steep terrain. So, I maintained silence. She immediately understood and said, “Apart from keeping silence, what else can you do?” the next 15 minutes, she kept grumbling at the back, and I drove in silence.</p><p>After dropping her in the Medical College, while returning, I started thinking, over time, how I have reacted to this problematic husband-wife conversation after my marriage. During the first few years, I used to say, “I know this is a new environment for you, so please try to adjust. In next few years, the rumblings increased, so we both started retaliating, “I am right, and you are wrong. First, admit it! That was your fault. There is no point in discussing this nuisance; after another couple of years, I felt that. We never reach anywhere. So, better keep mum and wait for the law of gravity to settle it down over time. It saves time and reduces anxiety.</p><p>Moreover, somewhere growing up in a highly moral value-based Indian family, some of us have learned to suppress our feelings because we being are taught that other people’s feelings are more important. Why rock the boat and jeopardize the relationship? Silence is golden. </p><p>I am sure many of you reading this article might have gone through the same phase, the same dilemma at some point in time. </p><p>Is silence the right approach? Is talking about feelings and managing feelings important? Can we move away from intricate conversation by avoiding it? </p><p>Maybe silence is a way out in the short term, but feelings are too strong to be kept bottled peacefully. They are bound to get heard one way or another, whether it leaks or bursts. If handled inappropriately, through silence, it may contaminate communication for a long, long time, and probably it has happened with me over time. But it’s not easy to discuss feelings which I have realized over the past decade. It’s confusing and stressful for both of us. Then what is the way out? </p><p>So, I decided to read a book named “Difficult Conversation” by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen. Though it’s an equally tricky book to untangle awkward conversation, I found one particular 3 step approach appealing. If feelings are the real issue, feelings should</p><p>The real problem is we never express feelings, and we express judgments (like you are overreacting) attributes (why are you trying to hurt me), blame (you are wrong, I am right, first accept it). But feelings are different. They are hiding inside these emotional labels. <b>Feelings </b>are love, anger, hurt, shame, fear, joy, sadness, gratitude, loneliness, etc. </p><p>The first important step is to find out these feelings lurking under attributions, judgment, accusations. Next is to express the full spectrum of our feelings. And how? Always starting the sentence with “I feel……” As the word “I feel” has got some magic in it.” For instance, if one cannot be the best husband/wife, but can feel angry, lonely, and hurt because of constant complaints and fears.</p><p>After expressing our feelings honestly, the second step is to<b> acknowledge </b>other’s feelings. Without acknowledging your partner’s feelings, you can’t leap towards problem-solving. For example, “This is how I feel, now tell me more about your feeling.” After he or she expressed his or her feelings, it is essential to acknowledge their feelings. “I am glad that you are sharing your feelings with me and it seems really important to you”. Acknowledging feelings is crucial in any relationship. </p><p>The third and final step is to <b>lead</b>the conversation. You may be reading this blog, but your partner is not. So, you will talk about understanding, and they will talk about who is right. You will talk about how each of you has contributed to the problem, while they are stuck in blame. You will bend backward to listen, acknowledge their feelings, but in return, you will be attacked, interrupted, or judged. Then what to do?</p><p>When other person heads in a destructive direction, <b><em>reframing </em></b>puts the conversation back on track. How to do reframing? Suppose someone says, that they are right and there is no other ways about it!” You reframe: “You feel strongly about it. I want to be sure I understand your perspective. I would also like to share my perspective on the situation.” When they say, “It is your fault.” You reframe - I am sure I have contributed to the problem; I think we both have. Instead, then focussing on whose fault this is, I would like to look at how we got here.” Above all, the single most crucial skill to master is<b><em>listening</em></b>No matter how good you get at reframing, you can’t move the conversation in a positive direction until the other person feels heard and understood. And they won’t feel heard and understood until you have listened. Reframing and listening involve leading the conversation in the direction you want it to go.</p><p>Most difficult conversations are not a single conversation. They are a series of exchanges that happen over time. If we can master that skill, by this three-step simple formula - 1) digging out feelings underneath the labels of judgment, attributions, and blame, 2) Acknowledging other’s feelings 3) Leading the conversation with constant reframing and listening, we can stop avoiding difficult conversations. </p><p>It will help our personal life and how we deal with our children, parents, landlords, tenants, suppliers, customers, bankers, neighbours, patients, employees, and colleagues of any kind. It’s a skill, and with practice, you can surely get better at it.</p>"

        content: "<p>We are living in times where talent is in TikTok, tales are on Tinder, friendship is on Facebook and food is on Swiggy. Everything, yes almost everything, is available at the click of the button. Yet, there is so much of haplessness, hopelessness and restlessness around. I have two kids aged ten and five. Both are poles apart when it comes to their attitude. But both have one thing in common; they both get so restless at times. Yes, they are next gen children. And restlessness is something which is worrisome for all parents and this generation itself!</p><p>I started a practice when this pandemic struck and when I was introduced to this unexpected, unforeseen, untutored and unpracticed lockdown. With no domestic help at hand and the bare minimum available, I knew I had to reset, readjust, restart and refocus all my strengths and challenges. Maintaining happiness at home without the worldly attraction was differently difficult. To convince children that we are all together, under one roof, with all the basic facilities and even much more, than what many people simply dream of was not even strenuous but perplexing too.</p><p>I resorted to what I feel I am most comfortable at; praying, reading, assimilating, writing and then speaking. I made it mandatory for them that they would have to pray to the Almighty, the supreme power. Their wild imagination of a supreme being could be anything. I didn’t show them whom to pray to or how to pray. But made it very clear that they would have to pray  whichever way they are comfortable in. For me, my savior could be Hanuman, for them it could be Krishna or Jesus or Allah! But I had to make them realize the presence of one supreme power. That there is something, somewhere, someone who is listening to them.At first, both resisted but when I put my foot down, they couldn’t do much but to follow. At times, they drew something as a prayer, at times they were cooking something for the lord, the other times we all sat down to sing hymns aloud. But then, after a fortnight, my daughter came up to me and said, “mum, I want to pray but I don’t know how to express myself, what to say in front of the lord, there are so many thoughts crossing my mind but I am unable to communicate.\”</p><p>That is the time, my role as a speech coach came to forefront. I showed her my diary. I have been writing a diary since I turned 13.  And with years, it has changed with my changing perception. In the recent years, I started adding a Thank you note to my diary. I try to find the positives in all the negativity I face and I have fathomed out one thing, if nothing at all works my way, that feeling of compassion and thankfulness is good enough to lull me into a deep sleep. I feel much lighter after I vent out my emotions. I asked my daughter to write a thank you note every day. Of course, she didn’t! I had to coax her every day and as we all know when the cat is away, the mice will only play. She only did it when I was around her. With my five year old son, I had to teach him how to speak it out. I sat with him and taught him to express; both his grievances and his thankfulness. Now, I look forward to that time of the day, when my daughter writes down her thoughts and my son speaks aloud his musings. And I can assure all of you that the restlessness is lesser, home happier and kids merrier.</p><p>My take away from this particular incident was that all of us have so much to share, so much to express but someone needs to hold hands to show us the way, that too for the simplest things in life. I sit down and wonder how much guidance these children need and once we gird up our loins to mould them, we make life smoother and easier for both. This training of expression both written and oral needs to be started early. But it is never too late ever. We have witnessed so many cases of depression amongst affluent and eminent people and the primary reason is the feeling of being gagged and being choked. We have to show the people around us the power of purposeful expression. And to me, to begin with, the easiest form was to say THANKYOU , to teach my children to say THANKYOU. Let us observe the surroundings keenly and let us start our journey of expressing ourselves with a simple word THANKYOU.</p>"

        content:"<p>A month ago, I was passing through a difficult time. My wife was going for 12 hours Covid duty in Medical College and started living in isolation. My domestic help’s daughter in law was diagnosed with Covid 19, so she too left. I was stranded with two kids and a 90 year old father at home. Well, I took it as my leadership challenge. I had to set goals each day, plan in advance, team up with my kids, motivate them not to worry about their mom, work with enthusiasm to move forward. Starting from helping the kids with their morning chores, online classes, cooking, washing utensils, brooming, mopping, telling stories, attending to my patients, I was all over the place.</p><p>One-day while I was cooking at night, Arka, my 10 year old son came to me and questioned, \"Dad, you cook such tasty dishes, keep everything so clean, where have you learned all these from? Who taught you, how to cook ?\" I was pondering from where to start the story. It took me into my memory lane 30 years back. </p><p>One fine Sunday evening, I was sipping a cup of tea with my father, when I asked him a similarly difficult question, \" Dad, why did you send me to a boarding school that too a missionary school at the tender age of 10?\" My dad replied, \"it's a slightly long story, but I think you need to know why I did, what I did. Let me start from my work life. In 1950, I got the first job of my life in United India insurance company. There I was given a task of assimilating 281 small scale insurance company in and around Guwahati, under one roof, for which I was offered a monthly salary of Rs.75.  I being the eldest of the 5 siblings,was responsible for the food, security, education and shelter of the whole family. I used to walk 30 miles daily to and fro from Narangi to Fancy Bazaar. 5 years later, I bought a bicycle. Then after another 5 years, with great hardship, I bought this land in Kahilipara, for 3000 rupees. At that time, it was more or less  jungle out here with no proper road. Everyone laughed when I bought this piece of land, but I was looking at the future. Then I got married, your sisters were born and then you. The struggle continued. But through and through, I was a self made man. From being a mentor to my siblings to accepting blames, handling mistakes and criticism, setting goals, focussing on the bigger picture, I was leading both at my workplace and my home. All the while I stuck to my values and attitude of putting the interest of others before me. As you grew up, I started taking you to market, teaching you the values of human engineering. But somewhere deep inside me, I wanted you to become a 'self made man' like me. I wanted my legacy to continue. </p><p>The opportunity came knocking at my door. One-day, a friend of mine came with this information that his son is reading in a boarding school in Deoghar, named Ramakrishna Mission, where they teach students by learning by doing methodology. I was more impressed to know that from making your bed, washing your utensils, clothes, dormitory to cleaning your toilet, you would have to do it all by yourself. I thought, this was the right age to push you into the sea of life.  That is why I sent you to that school eventhough I was struggling with financial hardships.\"</p><p>Back now, I realize, what my father was teaching me that day through his life's story. He was teaching me the nuances of leadership. Many people still have an erroneous understanding of what leadership really is. When you say leader, they think about, General, Prime Minister, President, Chairman, CEO etc. Obviously, people in those positions are expected to lead, but the true fact is that leadership doesn't begin or end right at the top. It is perhaps more important in places most of us live and work. Organizing a team at your work place, bringing more energy and enthusiasm amongst your employees, co workers, keeping things happy at home – these are the examples of front line leadership. Yes, leadership is not easy. But it is a learnable skill. Each one of us has the potential to be a leader every day. </p><p>Back now, I realize, what my father was teaching me that day through his life's story. He was teaching me the nuances of leadership.

I always believe, the true value of a person is measured by the legacy he leaves behind. What is your legacy ? </p>"

Or If I go to the boarding school but am unable to fetch the top grades, will I be wasting all your money?

I went on to hug my son. My eight and a half year old son! I knew I could never ignore this and I had to use my best possible communication skills. </p><p>I asked him, “What made you ask these questions?” He said  while he watches cartoons, there are so many advertisements where eminent personalities feature in convincing not to commit suicide, not to end life. He also said that they mentioned the above reasons behind this act. So he was forced to think upon those lines. For once I felt this world is really unsafe, it has been more than six months since we have stepped out,met anybody but my son was exposed to this horrific thought, at the comfort of our home, while watching cartoons and when I was around. I explained him that it is altogether a wrong thought process and only people who do not get help are forced into this. While nodding in agreement he added, “Mum SSR died even though he could have sought all kinds of help.” I didn’t want to get into the other angle of that muddling story.</p><p>I have always used story telling as my tool to communicate. And my son like any boy is deeply interested in stories about great warriors, fighters, leaders. To make him aware of one particular leadership challenge i.e. survival of the fittest, I narrated him the story of Alexander where he led a fleet of Greek and Macedonian boats across the Dardanelles Straits. On reaching the shore, Alexander ordered his men to burn the boats. With this he impelled and jolted his men to fight. They knew they had to fight with all their might to win over the enemies’ boats so that they could get back home. Alexander’s men fought bravely and confidently and won over the enemy to get back home victorious. Before my son got restless to imply this, I had to elaborate it and make it relatable to today’s world.</p><p>I went on to question him so that he could startle me with his answers, “Why would you still be unhappy when you would have best of both the worlds? What made you realize that your fat salary or your top grades would give me ultimate happiness? And the last one, if I behaved like Alexander, burnt all your resources to get back home and left you stranded in an unknown place amidst strangers to fight for your survival, would you simply give up just because you are being drifted to think over the negative consequences?</p><p>He answered after giving a deep thought, “Mum if I ever feel you are avoiding a communication, I don’t have shoulder to cry on, I can’t talk about my hindrances and failures that is the time I would feel I am a loser, even if I have everything. But mum, if we are always in touch and we stand for each other through thick and thin, even if you leave me on a deserted island, I would build up a bridge and come to you at the earliest because I know you would be looking at the doorstep every single moment until I returned.”</p><p>The room was dark and I could hide my tears from him but his arms around me were enough to make me feel the reason for an adverse step. We all want to be wanted. I kissed him and reassured him that neither I would ever burn the bridge nor the boats, only to see him getting into a deep sleep. I am here for him, for my family, for my friends, for my neighbours, for everyone whom I know or even a stranger when it comes to communication, when it is a matter of survival.</p>"

        content: "<p>It was a hectic Saturday afternoon. I returned from my chamber at 3.30 pm. After a quick shower, I was planning for the Micmellows online class, which was about to start at 4pm. Suddenly, I got a call. Immediately I could recognize the caller. A panicky mother from my locality. \"Sir, my child is having fever since morning. Now the fever has gone past 100°F. Are you in the chamber? I want to show you immediately.\" I replied, \"No, I am sure you know my chamber timing. At this time, I am at home.\" She said, \" Sir, can I come to your home ?\" I replied, \"No, sorry I don't see fever patients at home. I hope you understand the reason behind it. For the time being, give him paracetamol. You can repeat the dose of paracetamol every 4 hourly if temperature goes above 101°F. Do a Covid 19 test tomorrow early in the morning in the nearby school. Since, Sunday my chamber remains closed, if Covid 19 rapid test comes out to be negative, the result of which you will get in an hour, you can bring him to me if it is urgent.\" Exasperated she replied, \"That means, what you are saying, without a Covid 19 test, you will not check my child. This is so ridiculous.\" I replied,\"I shall surely check your child on Monday, without a Covid 19 test at my chamber, but not at home\" Sarcastically she said, \"You have got name and fame, that is why, you have become such an irresponsible doctor now.\" Saying so, she kept the phone. As you can see, this is a classic example of communication failure. The means applied was violence. </p><p>Now, let us see the second scenario. My wife was angry with one of her colleague Susmita, over last one year or so. She told me on few occasions, that Susmita ignores her, doesn't include her in any group conversation, acts like a leader bossing all around, downplays her contribution in front of the head of the department. Last Sunday, when we were chatting  over a cup of tea, she said, \"Do you know, today I caught the liar red handed. Yesterday night when I asked her \"Have you completed your review literature of the thesis ? She replied sarcastically \"No, I am not that fortunate.I don't have a husband who will do typing for me. Today morning when I went to the madam's chamber, I found she was already there, before me, getting her review literature checked by HOD. See, she is such a cheap girl. She says one thing, and does another.\" </p><p>Then I asked my wife a tricky question, \"Have you ever discussed the problem with her openly, honestly and effectively. Exasperated, she immediately replied, \"Do you think she will listen to me ? Do you think, she gives a damn to my feelings. She is a pigheaded rogue..Hah!! there is no point talking to her.\" Now this is another form of communication failure. Communication murdered by silence. </p><p>Let us see, why communication failure happened in both the cases ?</p><p>As Kerry Patterson, Joseph Granny, noted in their book 'Crucial Conversations'.- We are all great internal story tellers. As we face numerous difficult conversations in our day to day life, to justify our behavior and make us feel good about ourselves, we start telling ourselves three smart stories - Victim story ( where we make ourselves innocent sufferers. The other person is bad, wrong, dumb and we are good, right, brilliant), Villain stories ( here we exaggerate our own innocence and overemphasize the other person's guilt or stupidity), helpless stories ( here we tell ourselves, the other person is such a monster, hardly I can do anything to change the situation, so better stay silent and suffer). If you see the first scenario, the mother justified herself by telling  the victim story and the villain story. In the later case, my wife justified her actions by telling herself the villain story and helpless story. These endless internal stories that we frame each day, every moment,breaks the chain of communication.</p><p>Now what do good communicators do differently than the poor communicators ?</p><p>Now what do good communicators do differently than the poor communicators ?</p><ol><li>They try separating facts from stories.</li><li>They question -Am I pretending not to notice my contribution to the problem.</li><li>They ask one more question - What do I really want ?</li></ol><p>In the heat of the moment, within a blink of eye, when we generate stories, we begin to believe our stories as facts. The fact in the first story was that - the mother called the doctor to show his febrile child at his residence, wherein doctor asked her to give paracetamol for the time being, to get the Covid 19 rapid test done the next  morning (which was a Sunday) and if negative, and urgent, to bring the child at his home. Rest all the conversations that happened between the two people were their own smart stories.</p><p>Similarly, in the second scenario, Susmita told my wife,in the evening, that she hasn't completed her thesis yet. However, next morning, my wife discovered that she has already completed it and was getting her thesis checked by HOD, before my wife reached there. This is the fact.</p><p>Now different people may interpret the facts differently. Someone will find the doctor's behavior ridiculous, whereas others in the same situation will think doctor has equal right to fear for his family. So, let me do the test and then show the doctor.</p><p>Susmita's friends might interpret that, WOW! Susmita is so hard working, she burnt midnight oil and completed the thesis, whereas my wife who was already annoyed with her due to past experience, saw it in a different perspective. Our conclusions are subjective.</p><p>Now, the question comes, how to identify during the actual conversation, whether we are using our own smart stories. Always, keep a watch or spot whether you are using \"hot words\" in your communication and thinking. Let me take out few words used in the two stories above - Panicky, irresponsible,liar, pigheaded, rougue. When you start using these words, it means you are using your own judgement, your own stories to justify your behavior. Smart communicators, are expert in ferreting out facts from their own smart stories.</p><p>After separating facts from the story, good communicators, look for their own contribution to the problem. In first story, the mother could have looked into her contribution to the problem ( her reluctance to go for the Covid test). In the second story my wife has grown resentment against Susmita over past one year, avoiding open, honest discussion with her. In all probability, she has spoken about this problem with all her kith and kin except the main actor Susmita.</p><p>After separating facts from the story, good communicators, look for their own contribution to the problem.
